  - title: Optimal Experimental Design using Reinforcement Learning 
    description: The project tackles the Optimal Experimental Design (OED) problem in spatiotemporal systems, where selecting sensor locations is computationally challenging due to combinatorial complexity. Using Reinforcement Learning, we reformulate OED as a sequential decision-making task and develop Deep Q-Learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search frameworks to optimize sensor placement. Our approach offers a scalable and adaptive alternative to traditional heuristic methods, demonstrating promising results on PDE-based systems such as advection, Burgersâ€™, and advection-diffusion-reaction equations.

  - title: Kinetic Defect for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws
    institution: Stanford University
    dates: January 2023 - August 2023
    papers: (Under Review)
    description: The research delves into the linear representation of conservation laws provided by kinetic formulation, specifically for problems with discontinuous solutions. It looks at a procedure to identify the kinetic defect measure, proven to exist (given the entropy solution exists) but analytically unknown. Successful identification of the kinetic defect measure provides an alternate representation of shock features, which is valuable for handling shock position-based observations in Feature-Informed Data Assimilation (FIDA).

    description: Introduced a mathematical formulation of feature-informed data assimilation (FIDA) that leverages information from distinctive events, such as shock waves, level curves, wavefronts, and peak values in dynamical systems to estimate state variables and unknown parameters. Unlike conventional data assimilation methods, FIDA employs a set-valued functional as its observation operator, incorporating a search process over a function of state variables. The FIDA's ability to accurately estimate model parameters under noisy feature observations using Particle Filter (PF) is demonstrated through three numerical experiments.
