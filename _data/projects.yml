  - title: Kinetic Defect for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws
    institution: Stanford University
    dates: January 2023 - August 2023
    papers: (Under Review)
    description: The research delves into the linear representation of conservation laws provided by kinetic formulation, specifically for problems with discontinuous solutions. It looks at a procedure to identify the kinetic defect measure, proven to exist (given the entropy solution exists) but analytically unknown. Successful identification of the kinetic defect measure provides an alternate representation of shock features, which is valuable for handling shock position-based observations in Feature-Informed Data Assimilation (FIDA).

    papers: (<a href = "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2023.112499">Paper</a>)
    description: Introduced a mathematical formulation of feature-informed data assimilation (FIDA) that leverages information from distinctive events, such as shock waves, level curves, wavefronts, and peak values in dynamical systems to estimate state variables and unknown parameters. Unlike conventional data assimilation methods, FIDA employs a set-valued functional as its observation operator, incorporating a search process over a function of state variables. The FIDA's ability to accurately estimate model parameters under noisy feature observations using Particle Filter (PF) is demonstrated through three numerical experiments.

  # - title: High-Precision Geosteering using RL and Particle Filters
  #   institution: Stanford University
  #   dates: October 2021 - April 2022
  #   papers: (<a href = "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2022.110682">Paper</a>)
  #   description: The project aimed at developing a high-precision geosteering strategy for directional drilling in oil and gas wells. The study combined Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Particle Filters (PF) to estimate the subsurface properties and optimize the drilling path. The RL agent learned the optimal drilling path by minimizing the distance between the actual and target locations, while the PF estimated the subsurface properties using noisy measurements. The proposed strategy demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional geosteering methods.

  - title: Parameter Estimation in Stiff Systems
    institution: Los Alamos National Lab
    dates: July 2023 - September 2023
    description: The study focused on exploring techniques for parameter estimation in stiff systems using temporally sparse observation data. The study used a cyclic Lotka-Volterra reaction model varying over six orders of magnitude to emulate a stiff system and identified the limitations of unscented- and ensemble-Kalman filters in addressing these estimation challenges. Following this, optimization-based (variational) data assimilation methods were used to successfully identify uncertain parameters.
