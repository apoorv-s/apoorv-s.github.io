Intro: 
  <h3>Hello!</h3>
  
  <p style="font-size:115%;">I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>, working with <a href="https://tartakovsky.stanford.edu/">Prof. Daniel Tartakovsky</a> and <a href="https://me.stanford.edu/people/eric-darve">Prof. Eric Darve</a>. My research focuses on advancing tools and algorithms for inverse problems, data assimilation (DA), and uncertainty quantification (UQ) in highly nonlinear dynamic systems by leveraging optimization, machine learning, and other mathematical techniques. Currently, I am working on utilizing deep probabilistic models to enhance the efficiency of particle filters and exploring the information content of binary observations for state and parameter estimation. </p>

  <p style="font-size:115%;">In June 2023, I received a Master of Science (MS) degree in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in automatic and learning-based control from <a href = "https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>. Prior to my graduate studies at Stanford, I was an undergraduate student in the Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) program at <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in">IIT Bombay</a>.

  <!--<p style="font-size:115%;">I also worked as a design engineer and later as subsystems head in <a href = "https://www.teamshunya.com/">Team Shunya</a>, a collegiate team focused on designing and building highly efficient buildings powered by renewables, and I had the fortune of representing India in the prestigious <a href = "https://www.solardecathlon.gov/">Solar Decathlon</a> in Dezhou, China, in 2018 as part of the team.--!>

  <p style="font-size:115%;">More details of my research can be found on the <a href = "/research.html">Research Page</a>, and my CV can be found <a href = "/assets/documents/CV_Apoorv_Srivastava.pdf">here</a>.
